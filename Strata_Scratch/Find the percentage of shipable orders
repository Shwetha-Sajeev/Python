Find the percentage of shipable orders.
Consider an order is shipable if the customer's address is known.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

merged_df = pd.merge(orders,customers,left_on='cust_id',right_on='id')
merged_df['is_shipable'] = (merged_df.address.notnull()).astype(int)
result = 100 * (merged_df['is_shipable'].sum()/len(merged_df))
