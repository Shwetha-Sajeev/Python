You're given a dataset of health inspections. Count the number of violation in an inspection in 'Roxanne Cafe' for each year. If an inspection resulted in a violation, there will be a value in the 'violation_id' column. Output the number of violations by year in ascending order.

import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

df = sf_restaurant_health_violations
result = df[(df['business_name'] == 'Roxanne Cafe') & (~df['violation_id'].isna())].groupby(pd.to_datetime(df['inspection_date']).dt.year)['violation_id'].count().reset_index()
