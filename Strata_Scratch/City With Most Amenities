Airbnb
Hard

You're given a dataset of searches for properties on Airbnb. For simplicity, let's say that each search result (i.e., each row) represents a unique host. Find the city with the most amenities across all their host's properties. Output the name of the city.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = airbnb_search_details
df['amenities_count'] = df['amenities'].str.count(',')+1
grouped_asd = df.groupby('city',as_index=False).agg({'amenities_count':'sum'})
max_city = grouped_asd[grouped_asd['amenities_count'] == max(grouped_asd['amenities_count'])]['city'].tolist()
result = max_city
