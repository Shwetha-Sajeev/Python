ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

fraud_score["percentile"] = fraud_score.groupby('state')['fraud_score'].rank(pct=True)
df= fraud_score[fraud_score['percentile']>.95]
result = df[['policy_num','state','claim_cost','fraud_score']]
