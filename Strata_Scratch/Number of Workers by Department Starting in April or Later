import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime as dt

worker["joining_date"] = pd.to_datetime(worker["joining_date"])
worker["month"] = worker["joining_date"].dt.month

april_df = worker.loc[worker["month"] >= 4]
result = (
    april_df.groupby(["department"])
    .size()
    .to_frame("num_workers")
    .sort_values(by="num_workers", ascending=False)
    .reset_index()
)
