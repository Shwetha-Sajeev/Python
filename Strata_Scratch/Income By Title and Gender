Find the average total compensation based on employee titles and gender. Total compensation is calculated by adding both the salary and bonus of each employee. However, not every employee receives a bonus so disregard employees without bonuses in your calculation. Employee can receive more than one bonus.
Output the employee title, gender (i.e., sex), along with the average total compensation.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

sf_bonus_summary = sf_bonus.groupby(['worker_ref_id'])['bonus'].sum().to_frame('bonus').reset_index()
merged_df = pd.merge(sf_employee,sf_bonus_summary,left_on='id',right_on='worker_ref_id')
merged_df['avg_total_comp'] = merged_df['salary'] + merged_df['bonus']
result = merged_df.groupby(['employee_title','sex'])['avg_total_comp'].mean().reset_index()
