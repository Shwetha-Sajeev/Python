Output the rank, group name, and song name but do not show the same song twice.
Sort the result based on the year_rank in ascending order.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

conditions = billboard_top_100_year_end[(billboard_top_100_year_end['year'] == 2010) & (billboard_top_100_year_end['year_rank'].between(1,10))]
result = conditions[['year_rank','group_name','song_name']].drop_duplicates()
